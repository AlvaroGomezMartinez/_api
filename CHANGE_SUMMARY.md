# Change Summary: Disabled Data Push Features

**Date**: August 12, 2025  
**Requested by**: User  
**Implemented by**: GitHub Copilot Assistant  
**Updated**: August 12, 2025 - Re-enabled Alt_MS_Attendance_Enrollment_Count

## Summary

Successfully disabled most data push features while preserving them for future re-activation. **Alt_MS_Attendance_Enrollment_Count was subsequently re-enabled on the same day.**

### Currently Active Features
1. **Alt_MS_Attendance_Enrollment_Count** - Both email processing and manual data push to NAMS Criteria Sheet

### Disabled Features
1. **Allergies** - Manual data push to NAMS Criteria Sheet
2. **Entry_Withdrawal** - Manual data push to NAHS Criteria Sheet  
3. **Alt_HS_Attendance_Enrollment_Count** - Manual data push to NAHS Criteria Sheet

## Implementation Approach

✅ **Commented out configurations** instead of deleting them  
✅ **Preserved all functionality** in the codebase  
✅ **Added clear documentation** for re-activation  
✅ **Updated all relevant documentation files**  
✅ **No breaking changes** to existing automated features

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reversible**: Features can be quickly re-enabled by uncommenting code
2. **Safe**: No risk of losing configuration or breaking existing functionality  
3. **Documented**: Clear instructions for future re-activation
4. **Clean**: System continues to work normally without the disabled features
5. **Maintainable**: All changes are clearly marked and dated

## Testing Recommendations

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Automated email processing still works (Schedules, ContactInfo, Entry_Withdrawal2)
- [ ] Push Data menu still functions (should show no active configurations)
- [ ] System status checks work correctly
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in the console

## Future Re-activation

When ready to re-enable any features:
1. Follow instructions in `DISABLED_FEATURES.md`
2. Uncomment relevant configuration sections
3. Update documentation to remove "disabled" status
4. Test functionality
5. Update this change summary
