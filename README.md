# _API PROJECT
## Northside ISD<br>Department of Academic Technology
### Project Description
This project supports a Google spreadsheet that simulates an API. The spreadsheet contains multiple sheets that feed information to separate projects. The spreadsheet is meant to make data gathering more time efficient. Three of the sheets have to be manually updated, but another three can be automated using report subscriptions from Cognos. The three subscribed reports are sent to Alvaro Gomez's gmail and are labeled.
